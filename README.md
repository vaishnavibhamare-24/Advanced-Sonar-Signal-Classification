## 🚢 Advanced Sonar Signal Classification System

Underwater Mine vs. Rock Detection using ML, PCA, XGBoost & SHAP

Detecting underwater objects from sonar signals is a critical challenge in marine safety, defense, and autonomous navigation.
This project builds a high-performance sonar classification system using machine learning, dimensionality reduction, and explainability techniques, fully deployed with a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.

### 📌 Project Highlights

✔️ Performed EDA on 2,080 sonar signal instances

✔️ Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction & noise filtering

✔️ Trained & evaluated 5+ ML models

✔️ XGBoost achieved ~95% accuracy on test data

✔️ Added SHAP explainability to interpret model predictions

✔️ Deployed with Streamlit for real-time inference (<300ms latency)

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The dataset contains 60 sonar frequency-return features and a binary target:

R → Rock

M → Mine

EDA included:

Distribution analysis of all features

Correlation heatmap

PCA variance explained

Class balance

Outlier detection


### 📉 PCA Dimensionality Reduction

Reduced 60 → 15 principal components

Retained ≈95% variance

Improved model performance and reduced overfitting

Example:

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=15)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)

###  Model Training & Comparison

Multiple ML models were trained:

Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	83%
KNN	87%
SVM (RBF)	90%
Random Forest	92%
XGBoost	≈95% (Best)

### 🏆 Final Model: XGBoost

Optimized hyperparameters included:

max_depth

learning_rate

n_estimators

gamma

subsample

Saved model:
models/xgboost_sonar_model.pkl

### 🧩 SHAP Explainability

SHAP was used to interpret:

Global feature importance

Local explanations for individual predictions

Effects of PCA components


### 🖥️ Streamlit App (Real-Time Classifier)

The application supports:

Manual input or file upload

Instant prediction (Mine/Rock)

Prediction probabilities

SHAP-based explanation

Run the app:

streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
